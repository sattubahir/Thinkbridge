# Session 4: Flexbox Layout Lab

## Overview

This project demonstrates responsive web design principles using CSS Flexbox to create:

- A **responsive header navigation** that switches between a horizontal menu on desktops and a hamburger menu for smaller screens.
- A **card grid layout** using Flexbox with `flex-wrap` and controlled gaps for flexible, clean, and adaptable content presentation.
- Integration of these layouts into the existing portfolio HTML page.

---

## Deliverables

- `responsive.css`: CSS file containing all Flexbox layout styles for the header and card grid.
- Updated HTML (`index.html` or `portfolio.html`) with responsive header and card grid sections integrated.
- Vedio capture of responsive behavior.

---

## Features

- **Header Navigation:**  
  - Horizontal menu for large screens using Flexbox.  
  - Hamburger menu toggled via checkbox input for mobile devices.

  - **Card Grid Layout:**
