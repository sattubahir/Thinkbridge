# Session 3: CSS Fundamentals — Selectors, Box Model, Cascade

## Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental CSS concepts applied to a signup form, focusing on:

- CSS selectors and their specificity.
- Inheritance of CSS properties.
- The CSS box model: content, padding, border, and margin.
- Use of browser DevTools to visualize and understand the box model.

---

## Deliverables

- `index.html`: Signup form HTML file.
- `style.css`: CSS file with comments explaining selectors, specificity, inheritance, and box model properties.
- `screenshots/`: Folder containing before and after screenshots from browser DevTools showing box model visualizations.
  - `boxmodel-before.png`
  - `boxmodel-after.png`

---

## Features Explained

- Multiple selector types are used including element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and attribute selectors to demonstrate specificity.
- Comments in `style.css` explain how different selectors interact and override each other.
- Box model properties like `padding`, `border`, and `margin` are set with visual effects to illustrate their impact on layout.
- DevTools screenshots provide a clear visual confirmation of the box model concepts in practice.
